# Power Factor Improvement in Modified Bridgeless Landsman Converter Fed Compact EV Battery Charger

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and development of an Electric Vehicle (EV) battery charger that uses a modified bridgeless Landsman converter to improve the output power factor. This charger offers fast charging capabilities while maintaining a compact and cost-effective design. The reduced number of converters leads to both a smaller physical size and reduced cost, making it an ideal solution for modern electric vehicle charging systems.
